## Usage

You will be greeted with a welcome page, where you can choose to:
   - sign up / log in with username and password
   - sign up / log in with Github

Once signed up and/or logged in you will land on your dashboard where you will be able to:
   - create a member
   - create a gym class
   - you will also see stats/counters of the total: members, classes, and classes for the day 

At this time the app only allows you to:
   - Create + Edit Members / Gym Classes 
   - Schedule Sessions for those Gym Classes / Members
   - View information about members, classes, and scheduled classes
